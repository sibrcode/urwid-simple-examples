Easy to understand examples of how to use the Urwid module in Python

Although the repository for Urwid at https://github.com/urwid/urwid/tree/master/examples contains over a dozen examples, I found they were often too complex for me to easily understand how different objects fit together. In particular, Urwid is fairly particular about flow and box objects are combined.

These are my attempts at some simplified illustrations of typical Urwid programming patterns.
